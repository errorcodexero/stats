Which other teams is your team most similar to?

There are lots of papers ranking teams based on their on-field performance, but teams could also be compared based on the kind of awards that they win.  So for every team I've made a ranking of the top 10 teams that do similarly at winning awards.  

The format is as follows:
[code]team_number[most_similar_team,2nd_most_similar,...][/code]

Technical details:
-Data is taken from The Blue Alliance; fictitious teams exist if TBA says they exist.
-Similarity is calculated as follows: Sum of the squared differences between between each team's tendency to win an award type. 
Where 
[code]award_tendency = ((# of times won) - (expected # of times won)) / (events attended)[/code]
where 
[code]"expected # of times won" = sum over all events attened( # of times award given out / # of teams attending ) [/code]

Note that time doesn't come into this formula at all - winning something in 1992 is counted the same as winning it this year.  

Also, a list of least similar teams is not very interesting because it's almost always going to be a team that has only competed for one year and won a bunch of awards.
